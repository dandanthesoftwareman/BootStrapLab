            My name is Daniel Schuler. I'm a born-and-raised Michigander
            currently residing in Potterville, MI. I have been a musican since I
            picked up a bass at 14; because I've stuck to playing it I've been
            able to travel across the mitten to see the beauty of the state,
            playing shows all along the way. I love camping, hiking, finding
            good restaurants, a good craft beer, and working with my hands. When
            I'm not coding I'm generally doing house projects or out playing
            music with my friends.

            Like I said, I've been a musician since I was 14. I started pursing
            a career in music after my first paid performance in high school and
            in 2020 it became my fulltime job. I currently play in my original
            band

            when they need a bass player. I have also worked in recording
            studios, engineered for churches, built studio spaces, and given
            lessons as a part of working in the music industry.

            I made a transition to developing after a long winter season without
            gigs to play. I started to look into lines of work that would still
            allow me to play shows and tour. After ruling out jobs that required
            the skills I already had such as construction, electronics repair,
            painting, and clerical work, I turned to an old journal where I had
            written out a list of things I wanted to eventually learn in life.
            Somewhere on that list was "learn to program a computer". Next thing
            I knew I was asking anyone I knew that worked in the tech field
            about their job and what it was like to work it. My roomate at the
            time was a Grand Circus alumnus who helped talk me through my first
            few basic programs, I applied to the C# .Net bootcamp, and the rest
            is history.
